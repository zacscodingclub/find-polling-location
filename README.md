# Find A Polling location

This application is built to allow a user to enter an address within Buncombe County, NC or use HTML5 Geolocation feature to find the nearest early voting location in Buncombe County.  It is in the very early stages of 'working' and certainly has several bugs. This was built as part of a hackathon hosted by [Code for Ashevlle](https://github.com/CodeForAsheville) to help provide usable information to local voters.
